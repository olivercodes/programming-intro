# Tools Overview

In this section, we'll review the newly installed tools

## 1. VS Code

- Website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs
- Getting Started Videos (I recommend doing videos 1-5): https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos

VS Code is your primary code editor. It's like microsoft word, but for code. Another term for code editors, is IDE (Interactive Development Environment).

Recomendations:
- Do the getting started videos above (1-5)
- As you learn more about VS Code, start learning the keyboard shortcuts: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_keyboard-reference-sheets

## 2. Homebrew

- Website: https://brew.sh/

Homebrew is a program that helps you install other tools and programs, from the command line. Whenever you need a new tool, often there is a homebrew package that 
will help you install it. Homebrew greatly simplifies the install process for a lot of tools in our community. If it's a programming tool, there's probably a homebrew
 package for it.

## 3. Git

- Website: https://git-scm.com/
- Docs: https://git-scm.com/doc

Git is a command line (there are also open source GUI tools that work with Git) tool that allows you to maintain your file history, and collaborate on your
programs with other programmers. It is a tool that is 100% essential to every programmer. You will use it multiple times a day, every day. 

You may have noticed this website is called github.com. Not a coincidence. Most people interact with github.com, using the git program.
 
## 4. Docker

- Website: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Docs: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#docker-concepts

Docker is a `container runtime.` In a very oversimplified explanation, that means it's a program that abstracts and wraps other programs. Imagine you have some program
you wrote, and you want to ship it to other people to run on their systems. Docker, is a runtime that allows you to do that. You package your program up in a docker 
container, and then people can download and run your docker container. They don't need all the tools you have (that you used to write and test the program) because all 
of that stuff is encapsulated inside the docker container.

You'll learn more about docker down the road. But it doesn't hurt to start early! Docker is very important to the programming industry, and it is an essential tool.

## 5. ZSH

- Website: https://ohmyz.sh/
- Docs: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki

ZSH is a command line tool, that simplifies and customizes your command line terminal.
