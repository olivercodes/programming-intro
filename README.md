### Programming Intro Repo

Developing a "learn to program" github repo.

The guide encompasses 2 primary focuses:

1. Setup of your environment and familiarity with the tools
2. Katas

#### Why so much kata?

Perfecting the art or programming, is just like any other skill. Practice makes perfect.

Kata is also one of the most effective methods for learning programming.

#### Who is this for?

Beginners, new to programming and looking to learn from scratch.

The katas can be used by anyone at any level. More complex ones will be added over time.
